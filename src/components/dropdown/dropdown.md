## Interaction
* Dropdowns expose a menu that can be collapsed or expanded on user interaction.
* A clickable button with a right aligned arrow, showing which way of interaction is possible
* By clicking on a dropdown a list of contents or navigation points are showed. As soon as one option is selected, the
  chosen one is displayed in the main field and the options panel disappears.
  The exception to this is, if a list of multiple selecteable options -> 
* The width of the button and the options panel can differ, per default they should be the same.

## Usage
* Dropdowns help to save space
* Try to avoid dropdowns with fewer than 5 options, if there are more than 15 options consider using a search field or an other pattern to make finding and selecting easy.
* The list of the content can include icons if needed and dividers to enable grouping of options.
* In forms, dropdowns prevent users from entering erroneous data, since they only show available, correct choices.
