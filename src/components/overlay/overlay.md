### Scroll behaviour

The content part of the overlay grows and shrinks according to the size of the whole viewport. By default, it does not
add any scrolling behaviour so it does not interfere with inner overflowing content like dropdowns or tooltips. If you
want your content to be scrolled, just add `overflow-y: auto` to the container that should be scrollable.
